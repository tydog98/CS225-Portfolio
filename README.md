**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was a website made for a driving school looking to provide a more convenient form of driver education.
    
**What did you do particularly well?**

I believe what I did well in this project was breaking down the needed requirments and functions of the system.
    
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the UML charts, as they aren't very detailed at the moment.
    
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I broke the users needs into pieces that could be implemented into the system. When interpreting users needs you must be able to turn them from vague ideas into concrete and actionible requirements. If you aren't considering the users needs when designing a piece of software, then you are failing as a developer. The users are the people who need to use the software. If they cannot properly use and understand the software then why was it even made?
    
**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I generally break the software down into smaller and smaller peices that can be implemented and tested one step at a time.
